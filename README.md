Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the art of planning, designing, building and sustaining softwares. it is important as it helps in easy running of system and evsures timely delivery of services.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - planning of the whole process, manpower, time and techniques to develop.
Designing - the model to be built is then designed 
Development - The actual development then takes place and they start the work kf building the software.
Sustaining - When the software is built, it is now time to ensure it kasts and also runs effectively.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developers develop and maintain softwares  while Quality assurance engineers ensure the delivery of the services by the softwares is effective and user friendly. On the other side, project managers are responsible for overseeing the entire softeware development process.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergtated Devevolpment Environments are comprehensive softwares that provide a comprehensive set of tools to developers including editors, compillers, debuggers and version controls eg the Visual Code studio..
Version Control System are systems that help developers to manage different versions of codebase.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Poor network connection. - campaign for development of technology gubs and installation of net work boosters 
poor infrastructure the relevant authoruties should install relevant facilities to enable a sutable environment for developers and software enginering.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promot engineering is the art of generating a simple and well detailed oromt to enable the AI to effectively delivery good results.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
what is software engineering.

explain wgat is software engineering is simple English to enable a complete beginner to comprehend easily.
